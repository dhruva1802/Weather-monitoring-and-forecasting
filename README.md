# Weather-monitoring-and-forecasting
IoT-based Weather Monitoring and Forecasting Systems:
Can be used in various places like workplaces, schools, colleges, and offices.
Monitors temperature, humidity, and pressure.
Displays results on a user-friendly website.
Useful for various organizations.
Sensors:
Monitor parameters like temperature, pressure, and humidity.
Send data to an open-source platform (ThingSpeak) via Wi-Fi.
Data Processing:
Data is displayed as graphs on ThingSpeak.
Data is stored in the cloud and extracted as a CSV file.
Machine learning model (Time series analysis) processes the data.
Weather Forecasting:
Model forecasts weather values and displays them on the server.
Helps in taking preventive measures in case of emergencies or hazards.
IoT-based Commands:
Development of IoT-based commands using this project leads to controlling appliances and gadgets via the internet.
Machine Learning-based Weather Forecasting System:

Implemented in existing weather stations without changes to infrastructure.
Allows user/engineer to monitor and predict rainfall.
Microcontroller programs actions for electrical devices based on sensor readings.
Sensors monitor parameters like wind speed, direction, temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light luminosity, and rainfall.
Receiving and input sections for communication with a personal computer.
People can control power supply of electrical devices for an interactive environment.
Machine learning technology helps with historical data backup, making the system user-friendly.
